		<h2>Welcome</h2>
		<div class="divText">
			<p>Hi, my name is Kenn.  Towards the end of last year, I reached a not-too-pleasant life milestone.  I was overweight and and just could not muster up the energy and motivation to do anything.  I did however come across a book called <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12609433-the-power-of-habit>"The Power Of Habit,"</a> and I realized two things:
			<ul>
				<li> Throughout my life I have been accumulating positive and negative habits, and</li>
				<li>I can leverage positive habits while eliminating negative ones.</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p> Below are three keystones habit I have been implementing into my life since mid-December 2016 and that have helped level-up my life.</p>

			<h3>Early Riser</h3>
			<p>By nature, I am a night owl.  Although right now I am comfortably getting up at around 6:30 am, my goal is to eventually START my day by 6am.  Here are my top 3 reasons why I want to become an early riser:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Instead of being rushed to meet the needs of others, I now start each day foused on myself and my needs.</li>
				<li>There is something comforting and motivating about waking up with the sun rising.</li>
				<li>By the time other people are starting their day, I've already gotten a three hour head start on my day.</li>
			</ol>
			<ul>
				<li>Bonus: I actually get intense focused work done because there is no distractions.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Morning Routine</h3>
			<p>And because by getting up early, I've incresed the number of hours in my day, I've also starting incorporating some pretty powerful morning routins; again all which I am able to get done before I start my day meeting other people's expections and deadlines.  Here are my top 3 morning routines:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Making my bed as soon as I get up</li>
				<li>Meditating for 15+ hours</li>
				<li>Training for my first marathon</li>
			</ol>

	<h2>Meditation</h2>
	<div class="divText">
	<p>I used the <a href =" https://www.headspace.com"> HeadSpace App </a> to keep myself motivated and to provide me direction with my medittion practice.  I prefer to meditate in the morning so that I can prime my day for gratitude and success.  I find that by doing so, I my days are purposeful and I am not the stress-case that I used to be.</p>

	<p>	I've never been much of a runner.  In fact, I hated running!  My philosophy was, "Why run, unless you are being chased by a ear."  Well, that has all changed.  Towards the end of last summer, I decided to explore this anti-running attitude and decided to sign up for a half-marathon.  Not knowing what I was doing, I came across an excellent book called, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Non-Runners-Marathon-Trainer-David-Whitsett/dp/1570281823"> "The Non-Runner's Marathon Trainer." </a></p>
	Throuh the mental and physical techniques laid out in this book, I am not proud to say that I absolute love running, and I now know why people run....  hint: it's the addictive euphoric runner's high- IT'S NO JOKE!!!</p>
