		<td>Hi, my name is Kenn.  Towards the end of last year, I reached a not-too-pleasant life milestone.  I was overweight and and just could not muster up the energy and motivation to do anything.  I did however come across a book called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12609433-the-power-of-habit">"The Power Of Habit,"</a> and I realized two things:
		<ul>
			<li> Throughout my life I have been accumulating positive and negative habits, and</li>
			<li>I can leverage positive habits while eliminating negative ones.</li>
		</ul>
		Below are three keystones habit I have been implementing into my life since mid-December 2016 and that have helped level-up my life.</td>

<h2>Early Riser with a Morning Routine</h2>

			<h3>Early Riser</h3>
			<p>By nature, I am a night owl.  Although right now I am comfortably getting up at around 6:30 am, my goal is to eventually START my day by 6am.  Here are my top 3 reasons why I want to become an early riser:
			<ol>
				<li>Instead of being rushed to meet the needs of others, I now start each day foused on myself and my needs.</li>
				<li>There is something comforting and motivating about waking up with the sun rising.</li>
				<li>By the time other people are starting their day, I've already gotten a three hour head start on my day.</li>
			</ol>
			<ul>
				<li>Bonus: I actually get intense focused work done because there is no distractions.
				</li>
			</ul></p></td>
	</tr>

		<h3>Morning Routine</h3>
		<p>And because by getting up early, I've incresed the number of hours in my day, I've also starting incorporating some pretty powerful morning routins; again all which I am able to get done before I start my day meeting other people's expections and deadlines.  Here are my top 3 morning routines:
		<ol>
			<li>Making my bed as soon as I get up</li>
			<li>Meditating for 15+ hours</li>
			<li>Training for my first marathon</li>
		</ol>
		</p></td>

<h2>Meditation</h2>

	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/meditation.png" alt = "Kenn Sugiyama" style="width:240px"></td>
		<td><p>   I used the <a href =" https://www.headspace.com"> HeadSpace App </a> to keep me motivated and to provide me direction with my medittion practice.  I prefer to meditate in the morning so that I can prime my day for gratitude and success.  I find that by doing so, I my days are purposeful and I am not the stress-case that I used to be.
